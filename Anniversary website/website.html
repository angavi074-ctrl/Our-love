<h1>Happy 3rd Anniversary ❤️🥰</h1>

<p>Three years… three beautiful years of laughter, love, growth, and learning together. From our <span class="highlight">Lovable</span> days to endless muted video calls where we couldn’t hear each other but somehow understood everything  that’s when our love quietly started 🫂. Even then, I felt it the bond between us was special, unlike anything I had ever felt before 😍.</p>

<p>We’ve come so far together. From dreaming in whispered conversations to achieving the best results and now studying at the best universities 🎓, I feel so proud of us 🥹. But none of this our successes, our memories, our happiness would have been complete without you ❤️.</p>

<p>You are my best friend, my boyfriend, my husband, my everything 🥰. You are my backbone.</p>

<p>I also want to say something I’ve been holding in my heart… I’m sorry 😔. I’m sorry for the times I made you cry 😢, for the times I hurt you, and for the times I made you angry. I never wanted to, but I know I failed sometimes. I know that sometimes I was stubborn, sometimes careless, and sometimes I didn’t think before I acted.
But please know, I never stopped loving you 💖, never stopped caring for you, and never stopped wanting the best for you. Every time I hurt you, it breaks me inside because you mean everything to me 😭.</p>

<p>Thank you for being patient with me, for forgiving me, for holding me through my flaws, and for never giving up on us 🫂. You’ve been my rock through challenges, my motivation when I felt low, my joy in every small moment, and my safe place in this crazy world 🥰.</p>

<p>The way you love me, the way you care for me, the way you always make me feel special… I can’t even describe how lucky I am to have you 😍.</p>

<p>I promise to keep learning from my mistakes, to be more thoughtful, and to never take our love for granted ❤️. I want to grow with you, laugh with you, cry with you, dream with you, and hold your hand through every challenge life throws at us 🥹.
I want to make you happy always and be the kind of love that makes your heart smile 😘, even when life is hard.</p>

<p>As we step into our fourth year together, I want you to know this my love for you has only grown stronger 💘. I love you with every heartbeat, every thought, every piece of me 🥰. I am proud of you, grateful for you, and madly, completely, endlessly in love with you 😍. You are my heart, my home, my soul, and my forever 🛐.</p>

<p>Here’s to us, to our love, to the mistakes we’ve learned from, the tears we’ve shared, and the endless happiness that awaits us ❤️. I love you more than words can ever capture 💖… and I promise to spend every day proving it to you. Even when I mess up, even when I frustrate you, even when I hurt you, I will always love you Appu 😘.</p>

<p>My heart always beats for you 🥰…<br>
My mind always cares for you 🫂…<br>
My eyes always search for you 🥹…</p>

<p>Amma always loves you more than her soul, Appa ❤️🛐</p>

<p>These three years are just a sample , we’ll be together until our last breath. We’ll grow together, and we will definitely achieve all our dreams together, Papa 😘💕</p>

<p>Love you… love you a lot… love you more than anything, Kannaaa 🤌🏻❤️</p>

<p>You are my “Murugan thantha varam,” da Thanga pulla 🛐😍</p>

<p>And Now...<br>
"We are stepping into our 4th year together 😍💕🥹. We will definitely never stop stepping into a new year together until we leave this world 🥹🫂🛐."</p>
